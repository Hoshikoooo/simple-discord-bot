discord.py is an API wrapper for Discord written in Python.

This was written to allow easier writing of bots or chat logs. Make sure to familiarise yourself with the API using the [documentation][doc].

### Breaking Changes

The discord API is constantly changing and the wrapper API is as well. There will be no effort to keep backwards compatibility in versions before `v1.0.0`.

I recommend that you follow the discussion in the [unofficial Discord API discord channel][ch] and update your installation periodically through `pip install --upgrade discord.py`. I will attempt to make note of breaking changes in the API channel.

## Installing

Installing the async beta is easy:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@async
```

Note that this requires `git` to be installed.

## Quick Example

```py
import discord
import asyncio

client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print('Logged in as')
    print(client.user.name)
    print(client.user.id)
    print('------')

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.content.startswith('!test'):
        counter = 0
        tmp = await client.send_message(message.channel, 'Calculating messages...')
        async for log in client.logs_from(message.channel, limit=100):
            if log.author == message.author:
                counter += 1

        await client.edit_message(tmp, 'You have {} messages.'.format(counter))
    elif message.content.startswith('!sleep'):
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
        await client.send_message(message.channel, 'Done sleeping')

client.run('email', 'password')
```

Note that in Python 3.4 you use `@asyncio.coroutine` instead of `async def` and `yield from` instead of `await`.

You can find examples in the examples directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.2+
- `aiohttp` library
- `websockets` library
- `PyNaCl` library
    - On Linux systems this requires the `libffi` library. You can install on debian based systems by doing `sudo apt-get install libffi-dev` or on redhat based systems by doing `yum install libffi-devel`.

Usually `pip` will handle these for you.
