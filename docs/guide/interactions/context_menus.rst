Context Menus Guide
====================

Context menus allow for commands to be triggered through a context menu upon right clicking a related object in the Discord UI,
then selecting the name of the command to run from the "Apps" menu.

.. note::

    Context menus are not designed to be put inside of cogs. If you would like to use a context menu within a cog,
    you will need to handle creating the :class:`.app_commands.ContextMenu` yourself.


Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python3

    @app_commands.context_menu(name="User Context")
    async def example(interaction: discord.Interaction, user: discord.User | discord.Member):
        await interaction.response.send_message(f"Interacting with user {user}.", ephemeral=True)

    @app_commands.context_menu(name="Message Context")
    async def example(interaction: discord.Interaction, message: discord.Message):
        await interaction.response.send_message(f"Interacting with message {message.content}.", ephemeral=True)

- Context menus can be triggered from two possible sources: by right clicking on a user or server member, or by right clicking on a message.
- The ``name`` argument of the :func:`@context_menu <.app_commands.context_menu>` decorator defines the command name that appears in the context menu.
- The second argument can be of type :class:`.User`, :class:`.Member`, or :class:`.User` | :class:`.Member` for user context menus.
- Likewise, for message context menus, the second argument would be of type :class:`.Message`.
- Any messages sent to the :attr:`~.Interaction.response` attribute of the :class:`.Interaction` will appear in the channel that the user who activated the context menu currently has open.
- The profile image of the bot which owns a particular command will appear next to the command in the context menu.

The User Context Menu produces an option that looks like the following:

The Message Context Menu produces an option that looks like the following:

Checks
~~~~~~~

Context menus can be used to implement a variety of extended moderation features. Some ideas might include a ``Toggle Mute``, ``Warn``, ``Report``, or ``Info`` commands. For implementing moderation commands like these, it is useful to add checks to ensure that only those who are allowed to can the commands.

For examples of checks, view the :ref:`Interaction Checks Guide <guide_interaction_checks>`.
