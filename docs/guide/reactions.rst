Reactions
==========

Reactions are a feature within discord where you can add emojis next to messages.
They have many uses, but a common one for bots is for polls or giving feedback to a command without sending a new message.
Anyone can react to a message.



Adding a reaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding reactions is quite simple.

To add a custom emoji reaction you can do the following:

.. code-block:: python3

    await message.add_reaction("<:amogus:819046807370989599>")

Which would add a reaction to the message like so:

.. image:: /images/guide/topics/reactions/add_custom_emoji.png
    :scale: 50%


.. note::

    You must have the permission :attr:`~Permissions.read_message_history` to add reactions.

If no one else has reacted to the message using this emoji, you will also need the
:attr:`~Permissions.add_reactions` permission.

:meth:`~Message.add_reaction` can also take many types, not just :class:`str`. This includes :class:`~Emoji` or :class:`~PartialEmoji`.
For example, the following shows an alternative way to add a custom emoji reaction:

.. code-block:: python3

    emoji = client.get_emoji(819046807370989599)
    await message.add_reaction(emoji)

You may notice that if you try to add a standard discord emoji like ``:smile:``, you'll receive an error.
This is because to add standard discord emojis to a message, you must pass their unicode values.
Because of this, to add ðŸ˜„ / ``:smile:`` you would do either of the following:

.. code-block:: python3

    # pass the unicode emoji via the hexadecimal value
    await message.add_reaction("\U0001f604")
    
    # or

    # get the unicode emoji via the name (obtained via the unicode database)
    await message.add_reaction("\N{SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING EYES}")

This would then result in:

.. image:: /images/guide/topics/reactions/add_standard_emoji.png
    :scale: 50%

You can find the documentation for adding reactions to a message object at :meth:`~Message.add_reaction`.

Removing a reaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to remove reactions from a message.

It is similar to adding a reaction, but you must also specify a member to remove the reaction from.
This can be anything that meets the abc :class:`~abc.Snowflake`, like :class:`~discord.Member` or :class:`~discord.Object`.

.. code-block:: python3

    await message.remove_reaction(
        "<:amogus:819046807370989599>",
        guild.me
    )

This removes a custom emoji reaction with the id ``819046807370989599`` added by us (see :attr:`~Guild.me`) from the message:

.. image:: /images/guide/topics/reactions/remove_reaction_before.png
    :scale: 50%

.. image:: /images/guide/topics/reactions/remove_reaction_after.png
    :scale: 50%

Removing all reactions of a single emoji from a message is also possible: 

.. code-block:: python3

    await message.clear_reaction("<:amogus:819046807370989599>")

It is also possible to remove all reactions from a message, not just a singular member or emoji:

.. code-block:: python3

    await message.clear_reactions()

If you have a :class:`~Reaction`, you can also call :meth:`.clear() <Reaction.clear>` on that to clear reactions of that given emoji.

To remove a reaction that is not your own, you will need the :attr:`~Permissions.manage_messages` permission.


Getting reactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :attr:`~Message.reactions` attribute allows you to get a list of the reactions on the message. This returns a :class:`~Reaction`
per unique emoji on the message.

For example, to get all the users that reacted with a given emoji:

.. code-block:: python3

    # This fetches the first 5 users that reacted with that emoji.
    async for user in reaction.users(limit = 5):
        await channel.send(f"{user} reacted with `{reaction.emoji}")

You can also flatten the users into a list.

.. code-block:: python3

    users = await reaction.users().flatten()
    # users is now a list of User...
    winner = random.choice(users)
    await channel.send(f'{winner} has won the raffle.')

Next Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find further information about :class:`~Reaction` in its documentation.
Additionally, :meth:`~Client.wait_for` can pair well with reactions.
