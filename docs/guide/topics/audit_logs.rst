Audit Logs
============

Audit logs log various administrative actions taken in a guild. Examples include:

- When a channel is created, updated, or deleted
- When channel-specific permissions are created, updated, or deleted
- When a member is kicked, pruned, banned, unbanned, updated, has their roles changed, or is moved or disconnected from a voice channel
- When a bot is added to the guild
- When a role is created, updated, or deleted
- When an invite is created, updated, or deleted
- When a webhook is created, updated, or deleted
- When an emoji is created, updated, or deleted
- When a message is deleted, bulk-deleted, pinned, or unpinned
- When a thread is created, updated, or deleted
    
Depending on the action taken, an entry in the audit log may contain additional info about that specific action, including:



.. warning:: 

    There are a couple of limitations with audit logs that need to be understood:

    1. There is no guarantee on audit logs arriving when expected (if they arrive at all)
    2. No event is triggered when an audit log entry is created.
    3. Audit logs are limited to 45 days.
    4. No entry is created for message deletes if:

      - it is a bot deleting a single message, or
      - it is the message author deleting the message

Each entry is an instance of :class:`AuditLogEntry`, which contains information about that particular entry, including:

- Reason
- When it was created
- What category the action falls into
- A list of changes in this entry
- The state of the target before and after this action occurred
- Any extra data provided about the action, for example:

  - The id of a channel, member, message, or role involved in the action
  - The number of entities targeted by the action
  - A role name
  - A type representing what the changed entity is.

Getting Audit Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Audit logs can be retrieved via :func:`guild.audit_logs`, assuming you have the :attr:`~Permissions.view_audit_log` permission. 

Note that this function returns an :term:`asynchronous iterator` and so to properly go through the audit logs, you will need to iterate over them.

Examples
==========

A handful of examples follow that walk through some use cases for looking at audit logs.

Getting and displaying all audit log entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python3

    async for entry in guild.audit_logs():
        print(f'{entry.user} did {entry.action} to {entry.target}')

Getting a specific number of entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python3

    async for entry in guild.audit_logs(limit=50):
        print(f'{entry.user} did {entry.action} to {entry.target}')

Getting and displaying all actions of a certain type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may want to know how many times users have been kicked to look for certain users being kicked repeatedly instead of being banned:

.. code-block:: python3

    async for entry in guild.audit_logs(action=discord.AuditLogAction.kick):
        print(f'{entry.user} kicked {entry.target}')

Getting all entries made by a specific user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perhaps we wanted to check to see if a specific mod in our guild is possibly inactive. We could 
achieve this by finding out how many actions they have performed in the past 90 days, like so:

.. code-block:: python3

    entries = [entry async for entry in guild.audit_logs(user=message.author)]
    await channel.send(f'{message.author} has made {len(entries)} moderation actions in the last 90 days.')

Sorting entries from oldest to newest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python3
    
    async for entry in guild.audit_logs(oldest_first=True):
        print(f'{entry.user} did {entry.action} to {entry.target}')

Filtering to a specific time range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This could be helpful if you are trying to find actions that occurred in a specific time frame. For 
example, maybe we want to see how many messages were deleted in a specific timeframe:

.. code-block:: python3

    deletes = [entry async for entry in guild.audit_logs(before=message.id, after=othermessage.id, action=discord.AuditLogAction.message_delete)]
    await channel.send(f'{len(deletes)} messages deleted before {discord.utils.format_dt(message.created_at)}')

.. note:: 

    If choosing to filter the audit log to entries after a specific time, the logs will be sorted from oldest to newest.
