"The library follows a `semantic versioning principle "
"<https://semver.org/>`_ which means that the major version is updated "
"every time there is an incompatible API change. However due to the lack "
"of guarantees on the Discord side when it comes to breaking changes along"
" with the fairly dynamic nature of Python it can be hard to discern what "
"can be considered a breaking change and what isn't."

"The first thing to keep in mind is that breaking changes only apply to "
"**publicly documented functions and classes**. If it's not listed in the "
"documentation here then it is not part of the public API and is thus "
"bound to change. This includes attributes that start with an underscore "
"or functions without an underscore that are not documented."
