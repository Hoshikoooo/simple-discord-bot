"There comes a time in the bot development when you want to extend the bot"
" functionality at run-time and quickly unload and reload code (also "
"called hot-reloading). The command framework comes with this ability "
"built-in, with a concept called **extensions**."

"An extension at its core is a python file with an entry point called "
"``setup``. This setup must be a plain Python function (not a coroutine). "
"It takes a single parameter -- the :class:`~.commands.Bot` that loads the"
" extension."

"In this example we define a simple command, and when the extension is "
"loaded this command is added to the bot. Now the final step to this is "
"loading the extension, which we do by calling "
":meth:`.commands.Bot.load_extension`. To load this extension we call "
"``bot.load_extension('hello')``."

"Extension paths are ultimately similar to the import mechanism. What this"
" means is that if there is a folder, then it must be dot-qualified. For "
"example to load an extension in ``plugins/hello.py`` then we use the "
"string ``plugins.hello``."

"Once we remove and load the extension, any changes that we did will be "

"Although rare, sometimes an extension needs to clean-up or know when it's"
" being unloaded. For cases like these, there is another entry point named"
" ``teardown`` which is similar to ``setup`` except called when the "
"extension is unloaded."
