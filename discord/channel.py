        """Handles permission resolution for a :class:`User`.

        This function is there for compatibility with other channel types.

        Actual direct messages do not really have the concept of permissions.

        This returns all the Text related permissions set to true except:

        - send_tts_messages: You cannot send TTS messages in a DM.
        - manage_messages: You cannot delete others messages in a DM.

        This also checks the kick_members permission if the user is the owner.

        Parameters
        -----------
        user: :class:`User`
            The user to check permissions for.

        Returns
        --------
        :class:`Permissions`
            The resolved permissions for the user.
